## Landing Page 

### Intro (no title)
An interactive installation exploring the physics and beauty of light and sound. SPECTRA invites viewers to engage with the natural forces that shape how we see and hear the world.

This website, along with all the projects within in, were created, designed, and composed by Xander Munc as a part of his 2025 degree project.

To learn more about the projects check out the about page.

### The Projects 
SPECTRA explores work in motion, information design, typographic design, book covers, 3D, interactivity, and more. The gallery below holds all projects and explorations. To check out the interactive lessons, begin exploring the lessons tab above.

## Overtone Series 

### Poster

The Overtone Series, also known as the Harmonic Series, is a natural phenomenon in which a single pitch, the fundamental frequency, produces additional harmonic frequencies above it. 

This occurs in all natural forms of sound that can be identified by pitch, as they produce a fundamental frequency.

These overtones occur due to the physical resonant properties of the sound's source, forming the foundation of musical acoustics, timbre, and harmony.


## Hydrogen Emission Spectrum 

The Hydrogen Emission Spectrum is a series of spectral lines that are emitted when hydrogen gas is excited. The spectrum consists of several series, including the Balmer series, which is visible in the optical range.

The Balmer series is responsible for the colors seen in hydrogen gas discharge tubes, and it provides important information about the energy levels of hydrogen atoms.
