## Landing Page 

### Intro (no title)
An interactive installation exploring the physics and beauty of light and sound. SPECTRA invites viewers to engage with the natural forces that shape how we see and hear the world.

This website, along with all the projects within in, were created, designed, and composed by Xander Munc as a part of his 2025 degree project.

To learn more about the projects check out the about page.

### The Projects 
SPECTRA explores work in motion, information design, typographic design, book covers, 3D, interactivity, and more. The gallery below holds all projects and explorations. To check out the interactive lessons, begin exploring the lessons tab above.


## Hydrogen Emission Spectrum 

he Hydrogen Emission Spectrum is a series of spectral lines that are emitted when hydrogen gas is excited. The spectrum consists of several series, including the Balmer series, which is visible in the optical range.

The Balmer series is responsible for the colors seen in hydrogen gas discharge tubes, and it provides important information about the energy levels of hydrogen atoms.
