## Landing Page 

### Intro (no title)
An interactive installation exploring the physics and beauty of light and sound. SPECTRA invites viewers to engage with the natural forces that shape how we see and hear the world.

This website, along with all the projects within in, were created, designed, and composed by Xander Munc as a part of his 2025 degree project.

To learn more about the projects check out the about page.

### The Projects 
SPECTRA explores work in motion, information design, typographic design, book covers, 3D, interactivity, and more. The gallery below holds all projects and explorations. To check out the interactive lessons, begin exploring the lessons tab above.

## Overtone Series 

### Poster

The Overtone Series, also known as the Harmonic Series, is a natural phenomenon in which a single pitch, the fundamental frequency, produces additional harmonic frequencies above it. 

This occurs in all natural forms of sound that can be identified by pitch, as they produce a fundamental frequency.

These overtones occur due to the physical resonant properties of the sound's source, forming the foundation of musical acoustics, timbre, and harmony.


## Hydrogen Emission Spectrum 

### Description

First of a four part poster series, this poster answers the questions: How do atoms create light? And what is the Balmer Series?

### Landing

The Hydrogen Emission Spectrum is a series of spectral lines produced when hydrogen gas absorbs and releases energy in the form of light. The spectrum consists of several series, including the Balmer series, which is the only series of hydrogen's emissions in the visible light spectrum.
 
These specific emission colors are unique to hydrogen and reveal the discrete energy transitions of its electrons and the quantized nature of electron movement.

Answering the question: "How do atoms create light?" by using Hydrogen, the most abundant element, as an example. I set out to combine the separated "map" and "graph" approaches to representing this data into one hybrid form.

### Poster

Atoms emit light when electrons transition to lower energy levels around the atom, called orbitals. When electrons absorb energy, they move to higher orbitals, entering an excited state.

Each orbital has a specific energy level. To move between orbitals, an electron must absorb or release a precise amount of energy that matches the difference between those energy levels.

Higher orbitals emit photons of shorter wavelengths, producing bluer light. Most emission wavelengths fall outside the visible spectrum, into ultraviolet and infrared ranges. In hydrogen, visible light comes from the Balmer series, where electrons transition to the second orbital.

Each orbital change releases a specific amount of energy (eV)

which creates a specific wavelength of light (nm)


## Electron Probability Distribution 

Electrons in atoms are described by quantum mechanics as existing in regions of space called orbitals, where the probability of finding an electron is highest.

Unlike classical orbits, electrons do not follow fixed paths but instead form “clouds” around the nucleus, with denser regions indicating higher probabilities.

1s, 2s, and 3s, are the simplest electron formations.
